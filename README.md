Quaternion Nuclear Norm minus Frobenius Norm Minimization for color image reconstruction


This is the code of "Yu Guo, Guoqing Chen, Tieyong Zeng, Qiyu Jin and Michael Kwok-Po Ng. Quaternion Nuclear Norm minus Frobenius Norm Minimization for color image reconstruction[J], Pattern Recognition, 2025, 158:110986. doi: 10.1016/j.patcog.2024.110986."

Demo.m is color image denoising.
Demo_MC.m is color image inpainting.

qtfm.zip is the quaternion toolbox download from 
https://sourceforge.net/projects/qtfm/, please unzip it and add to your path. 

The detailed please see the corresponding paper.
